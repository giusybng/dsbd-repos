# Logging System

## Test the application

Open [project8](https://github.com/giusybng/dsbd-repos/tree/master/project8) as it is the *maven project* that contains the *Spring Boot* loggingsystem application and other useful folders

The ```docker-compose build```, ```docker-compose up``` and ```docker-compose down``` commands must be run from the terminal inside the [deploy folder](https://github.com/giusybng/dsbd-repos/tree/master/project8/deploy) as the *docker-compose.yml* is located there

## Fake producer

Run the command: ```docker-compose run debug-container bpython```
